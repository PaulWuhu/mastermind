# Project description
This is a game where a player tries to guess the number combinations. At the end of each
attempt to guess the 4 number combinations, the computer will provide feedback whether the
player had guess a number correctly, or/and a number and digit correctly. A player must guess the right number combinations within 10 attempts to win the game. Player can sign up, log in, and have their score be recorded. Player have the ability to check all user'score, and play without signing up. 

# Running the Project
 * Clone/pull the Project
 * run ```cd back-end```
 * create/active your Python Virtual Environment for your OS 
 * run ```pip install requirement.txt``` for the dependency 
 * ```cd mastermind_backend```
 * run ```python manage.py runserver ``` to start django server for both the sqlite and backend AIP endpoint
 * cd into the most outer layer of the project 
 * ``` cd front-end```
 * run ``` npm install``` for the dependency
 * run ```npm run dev ``` for front-end UI 
 * backend runs on localhost 8000, frontend runs on localhost 5173
 * App was tested on Chrome 
 
# Game Rule 
At the start of the game the We will randomly select a pattern of four different numbers from a total of 8 different numbers, from 0 to 7! A player will have 10 attempts to guess the number combinations. At the end of each guess, We will provide some feedback for your guess. Try to guess the correct combinations before the attempts runs out. 

# Tech Stack
Web-development is the most familiar form of Software development for me . Therefore, I decided to make a web-based game for this challenge. Although there are many different language to choose from for web backend development, the one I am most confident about is Python. After deciding the language, I need to choose a framework. There are two main python framework to choose from, Flask or Django. I personally like to use Django more because of the built in database, testing framework, Django admin and the entire ecosystem around the framework would make the development experience much smoother.
For the front-end, I choose the go to framework for many different web today, React. For the CSS, I choose to use tailwind CSS, as I believe its the easiest css tool to use. Although there are a lot of extra library to use with React, I choose not to use any external library for the front-end, to make sure I have full control of my code. I also choose TypeScript for its strict typing system to ensure code quality, so no any. 

# Code Structure
![first layer of project text](img_for_readme/first_layer.png)
* This is the first layer into the project, I divided into two separate folder, one for front-end and one for backend. 

![backend structure](img_for_readme/backend_structure.png)
* In the back-end folder, we have our basic python setup for git, and the mastermind_backend folder that contains the django project. Inside the project, we have the mastermind_backend folder for django setting, the built in sqlite database, and the user app for majority of the logic. 

![frontend structure](img_for_readme/frontend_structure.png)
* Inside the front-end structure, we have the basic setup for react with TypeScript. In side the src folder, we have our app. In the assets folder, we have our contexts provider for the app. And we have the rest of the app in  the components folders for each page. 


# Important File Purpose backend

![acl.py code img](img_for_readme/aclpy.png)
* The acl.py file contains a function for calling the Random generator API. We use a different function to call the 3rd party API. So the user will ot be able to call the API directly. 

![model.py code img](img_for_readme/modelpy.png)
* The model.py file is where we store our model for our database table. Each table would have id(generated by default), username, password, win and loss. Note, very important, the user model is from Models.model class, rather than the django build-in authentication models.

# API Endpoint
Both url.py and view.py together achieve our routing need for API endpoint. We are using RESTful API. We have a total of 6 endpoint. 
They are: 
1. get_random_number for getting a random number
2. log_in for logging in a user
3. signup for create user
4. api_get_user for getting a user or deleting a user
5. api_get_all_user for get all the user
6. api_score for updating the score

## get_random_number 
``` python
@api_view(["GET"])
def get_random_number(request):
    response = get_random_number_from_api()
    res = JsonResponse(response, safe=False)
    return res
url = /user/api/get_random_numbers
```
This is the endpoint for getting a random number. we simply call the function that calls the 3rd party api, and we send the response as json to the front-end




# some more writing for each file i backend 
Inside the user folder, we have our acls.py, which contains a function for calling the Random generator API. In models.py we have the User model with different common.py is where we store the custom JSONEncoder for our user object.
